• Developed a Convolutional Neural Network       (CNN) model using Keras and TensorFlow for     automatic facial emotion recognition.

• Utilized OpenCV and NumPy for face             detection,image preprocessing and              dataset handling.

• Performed data preprocessing, including        reesizing,normalization and train-test         splitting for improved model performance.

• Evaluated the model using accuracy metrics     and visualized training progress with          Matplotlib, achieving aining prog effective    classification of emotions like happy sad,     angry and neutral.
